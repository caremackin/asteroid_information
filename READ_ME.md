# INST FINAL PROJECT: Asteroid Information and Graphing System

## Overview

This project serves as a comprehensive asteroid information and graphing system, showcasing skills in web scraping using NASA's public APIs, data manipulation with NumPy and Pandas, and data visualization using Matplotlib. The program prompts users to enter dates of interest, retrieves information about asteroids on those dates, and generates tables and graphs. The collected information is then written to a CSV file for user access. Additionally, the user can specify the minimum size of asteroids they want to see information about.

## Features

- **Date Input:**
  Users can enter multiple dates of interest to retrieve asteroid information.

- **Data Retrieval:**
  The program utilizes NASA's public APIs to gather data about near-earth objects on the specified dates.

- **Data Manipulation:**
  NumPy and Pandas are employed to manipulate and structure the retrieved data.

- **Graphical Representation:**
  Matplotlib is used to create tables and graphs, providing visual insights into asteroid information.

- **CSV Export:**
  The collected asteroid information is written to a CSV file, enabling users to access and analyze the data.

## Usage

1. Run the program and enter dates of interest in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD' when prompted.
2. Specify the minimum size of asteroids for information retrieval.
3. View tables and graphs generated for each specified date.
4. Access the collected asteroid information in the CSV file.

## Future Development

While the current version serves as a novelty, there are potential avenues for future development:

- **Pattern Analysis:**
  Explore patterns and trends among near-earth objects over different dates.

- **Advanced Data Analytics:**
  Implement more sophisticated data analysis techniques to derive meaningful insights.
